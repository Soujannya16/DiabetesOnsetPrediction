# DiabetesOnsetPrediction

Duration - 08.02.2020 to 08.04.2020

Skills used - Deep Learning

## Purpose
- The objective of this project is to design and develop an accurate prediction system for the diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus. 
- Diabetes is considered as one of the deadliest and chronic diseases which causes an increase in blood sugar. Many complications occur if diabetes remains untreated and unidentified. The tedious identifying process results in visiting of a patient to a diagnostic centre and consulting doctor. But the rise in machine learning approaches solves this critical problem
- 1 as a result means diabetes positive and 0 means negative.
